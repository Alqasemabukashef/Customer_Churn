Customer Churn Analysis
üìä Project Overview
This repository contains the solution to a Customer Churn Analysis project, which aims to explore and analyze customer churn for a telecom subscription-based business. By examining customer demographics, subscription plans, usage patterns, and reasons for churn, this project seeks to provide actionable insights for reducing churn and improving customer retention.

Objective:
Calculate the churn rate and identify key factors contributing to churn.
Investigate different churn reasons using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Explore customer demographics, contract types, data usage, and international calling behaviors.
Create a comprehensive dashboard in Excel to visualize churn insights.

üóÉÔ∏è Datasets
This project uses two key datasets:

1-Customer Churn Dataset: Contains detailed customer information, including demographics, service usage, churn status, and churn reasons.
2-Churn Metadata Sheet: Provides metadata and descriptions of the columns in the churn dataset, explaining how each feature (e.g., Churn Label, Contract Type, Gender, etc.) is defined.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
* Microsoft Excel: Used for data cleaning, calculations, and creating visualizations.
* Pivot Tables and Charts: These visualize churn data and provide key insights.

  üíª Features and Analysis
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates and ensuring data consistency.
Churn Rate Calculation: Converting the "Churn Label" to a binomial format and calculating the churn rate.
Churn Reasons Investigation: Analyzing common reasons for churn and creating a column chart to show the top churn reasons.
2. Churn Pattern Analysis:
Demographics: Analyzing churn based on customer demographics, such as age and gender.
Age Group Analysis: Grouping customers into different age bins and visualizing churn rates across these groups.
Unlimited Data Plan Analysis: Investigating if customers with unlimited data plans churn at lower rates.
International Calls: Analyzing how international call behavior influences churn, especially for customers with international plans.
Contract Type: Investigating churn rates across different contract types (Month to Month, One Year, Two Years).
3. Building a Dashboard:
Churn Overview Dashboard: Combining the above analyses into a dashboard that summarizes key metrics:
* Total customers
* Churn rate
* Churn reasons
* Demographics of churned customers

üìà Key Insights from the Analysis
Churn Rate: The overall churn rate and how it compares across different customer segments.
Churn Reasons: The primary reasons customers are leaving the service, such as issues with competitors, customer service, or pricing.
Demographic Insights: Identifying which demographics (age, gender, etc.) are most at risk for churn.
Contract Insights: Understanding how contract types influence churn behavior.
International Calling: Investigating whether international calling behavior or the presence of an international plan correlates with churn.
